    <P>Kalighat painting, Kalighat Patachitra, or Kalighat Pat (Bengali: কালীঘাট পটচিত্র) originated as a distinct style or genre of Indian paintings in the 19th century, practiced and produced by a group of specialised scroll painters known as the patuas in the vicinity of the Kalighat Kali Temple in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), in the present Indian state of West Bengal.[1][2] Composed of bold outlines, vibrant colour tones, featuring minimal background details, these paintings and drawings, done on hand-made, or more usually, machine manufactured, paper, depicted mythological stories, figures of Hindu gods and goddesses, as well as scenes from everyday life and society,[1][2] thereby recording a socio-cultural landscape which was undergoing a series of transitions during the 19th and early 20th century,[3] when the Kalighat pat reached its pinnacle.

        Today the Victoria and Albert Museum in London hosts the single largest collection of Kalighat paintings in the world, 645 paintings including watercolours, line-drawings and hand-painted lithographs.[</P>
